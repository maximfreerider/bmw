Hello guys, i`m working on my own BMW project, i want to make a new product platform for BMW's cars.
For start this project you have to download this on your leptop.
Open terminal, go to bmw folder
and write these comands:
1)python manage.py makemigrations 
2)python manage.py migrate
3)python manage.py runserver
If css styles is not displayed in your browser, change port from 8000 to 8001 and restart it
